### Project Brief:

Create a React Application and the application, perform the following tasks:

- Counter component to keep track of increment, decrement and reset
- Price compomnent to keep track of Product Name and Price
- Display discount and display discount logic
- ViewList component that takes in all state updates and displays in table
- Show the total price for each item row, including discount
- Show the sum total of all items in the table
- Show and compare sum with discount savings, in actual $
- Keep all calculations (business logic) in the higher-order Product component
- Update ViewList when adding new table columns
- As much as possible, keep the container and presentational components separated

Additonal implementations:

- Stats dashboard that takes in the accumulative values from the table and calculates `Total Expenses`, `Total Nett` and `Total Savings`
- Refactored the code using `useReducer` and `useContext` hooks ([refactor-reducer-context-branch](https://github.com/JustenMX/ntu-price-cart-app/tree/a0af1b5637e6c812c1bf9528352c8a34c8ca629a "branch merge history"))
- Add CRUD application to ViewList Component ([crud-viewList-branch](https://github.com/JustenMX/ntu-price-cart-app/tree/crud-viewList-branch))

Currently Working on:

- Further refactoring of the rest of the states and props
